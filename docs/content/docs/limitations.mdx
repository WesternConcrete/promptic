`promptic` is a lightweight abstraction layer over [litellm](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm) and its various LLM providers. As such, there are some provider-specific limitations that are beyond the scope of what the library addresses:

## Tool/Function Calling

- Anthropic (Claude) models currently support only one tool per function

## Streaming

- Gemini models do not support streaming when using tools/function calls

These limitations reflect the underlying differences between LLM providers and their implementations. For provider-specific features or workarounds, you may need to interact with [litellm](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm) or the provider's SDK directly.
