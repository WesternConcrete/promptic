The streaming feature allows real-time response generation, useful for long-form content or interactive applications:

```python
from promptic import llm

@llm(stream=True)
def write_poem(topic):
    """Write a haiku about {topic}."""

print("".join(write_poem("artificial intelligence")))
# Binary thoughts hum,
# Electron minds awake, learn,
# Future thinking now.
```
