`promptic` aims to be the "[requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)" of LLM development -- the most productive and pythonic way to build LLM applications. It leverages [LiteLLM](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm), so you're never locked in to an LLM provider and can switch to the latest and greatest with a single line of code.

## Installation

You can install promptic using pip:

```bash
pip install promptic
```

## Basic Usage

Functions decorated with `@llm` inject arguments into the prompt. You can customize the model, system prompt, and more. Most arguments are passed directly to [litellm.completion](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/completion/input).

```python
from promptic import llm

@llm
def translate(text, target_language="Chinese"):
    """Translate '{text}' to {target_language}"""

print(translate("Hello world!"))
# 您好，世界！
```

You can customize the model and system prompt:

```python
@llm(
    model="claude-3-haiku-20240307",
    system="You are a customer service analyst. Provide clear sentiment analysis with key points."
)
def analyze_sentiment(text):
    """Analyze the sentiment of this customer feedback: {text}"""

print(analyze_sentiment("The product was okay but shipping took forever"))
# Sentiment: Mixed/Negative
# Key points:
# - Neutral product satisfaction
# - Significant dissatisfaction with shipping time
```
